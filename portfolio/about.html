<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>Hello my name is Ryan Smart and for several years i have had a huge interest in learning software development and this past summer i decided to take the leap and attend CWI to start on my Associate Degree in Software Development.</p>

<p>Since I was 5 years old i have been in awe of what we can do with computers through watching my dad develop multiple websites and applications and it garnered me a vested intrest in computers and how they function so my goal is to achieve an even higher standard then what was set by my father.Through the College of Western Idaho I strive to achieve this goal and make my dreams a reality.</p>

<h2>Interests</h2>

<p1>I have many interests a lot of which consist of the use of a computer particularly video games and reading books however i also love nature and going camping. Magic The Gathering is another huge interest of mine it can be a very social card game to enjoy with others.</p1>
